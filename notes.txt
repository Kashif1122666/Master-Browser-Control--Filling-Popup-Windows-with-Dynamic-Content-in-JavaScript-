Chapter 79: Browser control-Filling-the-window-with-content

1. Openning a Popup window
   Popup window, though often blocked by browser due to misuse, can stil be useful in 
   some cases. Here's how to open a blank Popup window:

   var monkeyWindow = window.open();

This opens  a new blank window and assign it to a variable(monkeyWindow). The size and    
behaviour of the Popup depend on the browser , and it may open in new tab or a new window.

2. Filling a window with content : Method 1 - using document.write()

   You can use document.write() to add HTML content to the newly opened window:

       var monkeyWindow = window.open();
       var windowContent = `<h1> My Bicycle</h1><p>lorem the the doe  alwo alo wla</p>`;
       monkeyWindow.document.write(windowContent);

Explaination: 

    Line 1: Open a blank window.

    Line 2: Assign html to a variable.

    Line 3: Uses document.write() to fill the Popup with that HTML content.

Tip : Inside the main double quotes ("") , use single quotes ('') for any html    
attributes, such as in the src of an image tag.

3. Filling a window with content : Method 2 - using location.assign() or location.href

   you can assign an entire webpage to the Popup window:

   monkeyWindow.location.assign();

   This replace the blank window content with document from the specified url.

4. Filling a window with content : Method 3 - Openning a specific URL Directly    

   The most common and concise Method is to specify the webpage to open when creating the 
   Popup:

       var monkeyWindow = window.open("http://www.google.com");

    If the webpage shares the same host or directory as the original document, you can use    
     a relative path:

          var monkeyWindow = window.open("default.asp");

5. Closing the window          

    Once you're done with the Popup , you can close it programmatically :

       monkeyWindow.close();

Key points:        

     Openning a Popup: use window.open() to create a new browser window.
     Filling content: you can fill the Popup with content using document.write(), by 
     assigning a url with location.assign(), or by specifying a url directly in window.open
     ().
     Closing the window: use window.close() to close the Popup.

Popup can be a useful feature when used resposiblity , especially  in cases where additional      
content or document need to be opened seperately from the main page.
